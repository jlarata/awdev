							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In recent years, I began developing to solve problems or enhance practices in my workspaces.
								In doing so, I not only relied on my own judgment but also studied and analyzed how I could assist my 
								colleagues and myself in fulfilling our functions. This involved interpreting the objectives of 
								supervisors and clients, both in my administrative work and in teaching. My projects ranged from 
								simple Python programs to aid daily tasks and full-stack web applications for internal use to automate
								 tasks or improve information management. I also ventured into combining web design with artificial
								  intelligence in playful/pedagogical experiments in literature teaching.
								</p><p>
							   My original academic background is in humanities, having achieved the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA)
								equivalent of a master in Literary Theory, and for over ten years, I have been teaching language and
								 literature in secondary school. This experience has provided me with extensive communication and
								  group study/work organization skills. Concurrently, I have always had an interest in programming,
								   design, and gaming. A few years ago, I decided it was time to formalize this passion and started
									taking courses extensively. I began with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, followed by libraries
									 (Angular, React), database design, languages (Python, C#, Java, SQL), and diverse work environments
									  like Springboot and Unity. Currently, I am eager to enter the professional field, open to exploring
									   a wide range of possibilities that allow me to continue learning, develop, and specialize in any of
										these areas.</p>
